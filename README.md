**** PROJECT 2 : 90 DAYS OF PROJS *****

This Project I am going to demonstrate 
pagination with expressJS and a postgres
database. I will be choosing between a keyset
pagination and offset pagination, and displaying
a forum that sorts the posts in a timeline, with
the newest entries at the top. I will also implement
a dynamic layout that hides the sidebar in mobile view
and creates a hamburger button that will expand the sidebar
and close it
